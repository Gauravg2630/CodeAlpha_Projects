🚀 CodeAlpha Projects Portfolio
Welcome to my internship portfolio completed as part of the CodeAlpha Internship Program. This repository contains three full-fledged AI and Web Development projects, each created from scratch, combining deep learning, NLP, Flask, JavaScript, and clean UI/UX.

🧠 What I Learned
During this internship, I:
Gained hands-on experience with AI model training (LSTM for music, NLP for chatbot).
Developed full-stack apps using Flask, HTML/CSS/JS, and API integrations.
Understood end-to-end project flow from data processing to deployment-ready UIs.
Strengthened debugging, API routing, and user interaction handling.
Improved UI/UX design using dark/light mode, speech features, and responsive layouts.

📁 Project Structure
Each folder below contains a separate standalone project with its own README.md, codebase, and assets.

🔹 1. CodeAlpha_ChatbotForFAQs
A Python-based chatbot using NLTK, scikit-learn, and Flask to answer user FAQs in real-time.

Highlights:
Text preprocessing and intent classification
Chat interface built with HTML/CSS/JS
